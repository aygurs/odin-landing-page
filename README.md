# odin-landing-page
This is my second project using HTML and CSS that I have learnt so far. It's
a layout of a basic website landing page that could be used for a business or
any professional company.

I made this project following along with the Odin Project so far, and test my
HTML and CSS skills if I could replicate the image I was given. This project
demonstrates use of things such as:

- Div containers
- HTML baseplate creation
- Use of classes in HTML
- Unordered lists
- Use of flexbox to align items on the page
- Basic CSS
